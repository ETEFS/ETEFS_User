# ETEFS_User

## Introduction
ETEFS_User is a transparent file encryption SDK based on API hooking technology. It runs in ring 3 mode. ETEFS_User can encrypt those files containing sensitive data generated by the selected applications, such as Microsoft Word, Excel and Power Point. All files are stored in encrypted form on the disk. The encryption progress is executed at background on-the-fly, and does not interrupt the normal operation behavior of the end user. Because of developing by user mode API hooking technology, without any kernel mode drivers, it is easy to integrate ETEFS_User into your software product in a short development cycle.
